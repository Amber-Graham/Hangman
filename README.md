# Hangman
My Hangman project for The Odin Project!

This game is done purely on the command line using Ruby. 
You can see a live demo of this game through <a href="url">replit</a>.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
What I found most challenging of this was utilizing the YAML file. 
Once I was able to figure out how to pull the saved data it was pretty 
straight forward. Thankfully, there were several folks that helped me in the discord
when I was stuck. Made a few bonehead mistakes (like misspelling words!), but after 
taking a break and coming back I was able to see them. I really want to incorporate 
testing for this, because testing the game by playing it over and over was annoying.
I believe that will be one of the next things the curriculum dives into. Once that 
happens, I will come back and add testing for this game.
